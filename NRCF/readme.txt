This package implements a QoS prediction approach, NRCF, described in the 
existing work [Sun et al., TSC'13]. 

The implementations are based on a combination of Python (2.7) and C++ 
programming languages, in order to achieve both speed and simplicity. To do 
so, Cython (http://cython.org/) is used. The core algorithms are implemented 
using C++, and we obtain an overall of 10+ times speedup than pure Python 
implementation. 

You can refer to the README.md of WSRec repository for instructions of
installing Cython. But you do not need it if you only want to reproduce the 
experimental results by executing the scripts that I have provided (You may 
even not need any execution because I have also provided most of the results). 
Cython is only needed when you modify the c++ source files and want to 
re-compile them. In addition, it is worth noting that our implementation is 
also based on numpy and scipy packages (http://www.scipy.org/), so you would 
also need to install these packages first.

      - NRCF.so             - the external module built from C++ 
                              implementations from NRCF_core/
      - NRCF_core/          - directory of c++ implementation of NRCF
          - NRCF_core.h     - header file
          - NRCF_core.cpp   - source file
          - NRCF.pyx        - a python wrapper written in Cython for C++ 
                              functions 
          - NRCF.cpp        - This file is automatically generated by Cython 
                              for building NRCF.so
  - result/                 - directory for storing evaluation results
                              available metrics: (MAE, NMAE, RMSE, MRE, NPRE)
      - rtResult_0.01.txt   - E.g., the reponse-time prediction result under 
                              matrix density = 1%
      - [...]               - many other results

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ease of reproducing and compare with other approaches, we provide the 
detailed experimental results with five metrics (MAE, NMAE, RMSE, MRE, NPRE), 
under the "result/" directory, after running the above five QoS prediction 
approaches on "data/dataset#1". E.g.,"result/rtResult_0.20.txt" records the 
evaluation results under matrix density = 20%. In particular, each experiment 
is run for 20 times and the average result (including std value) is reported. 
These results can be directly used for your research work.

On the other hand, if you want to reproduce our experiments, you can run the 
program with our provided Python scripts "run_rt.py" and "run_tp.py".

>> python run_rt.py
>> python run_tp.py

Make sure that the external module "NRCF.so" exists and consists with your 
system. If not, you can build it by the follow command. Note that the current 
version only works on Linux.

>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
