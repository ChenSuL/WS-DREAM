This source code in "PMF/" directory is developed by Jieming Zhu<jmzhu@cse.cuhk.edu.hk>, 2014/2/5.

Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) approach is implemented with Matlab.

The source code is provided under "src" folder. You can directly run the provided Matlab scripts "run_rt.m" and "run_tp.m".

Note: 
"resultFolder/" contains the experimental results with five metrics (MAE, NMAE, RMSE, MRE, NPRE), after running the above five QoS prediction approaches on "data/dataset#1". E.g., "resultFolder/rtResult_0.20.txt" records the evaluation results under matrix density = 20%.
